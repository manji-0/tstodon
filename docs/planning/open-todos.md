Tracked leftovers so e2e work can proceed without losing them.

| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| D1-1 | Fan-out / expand-CPU SLO for secondary queue chunking  | Open Question — needs `outbox.expand` metrics evidence |
| D1-2 | Hard API max on list member mutation size              | Open Question — do not invent a number                 |
| D1-3 | Promote hashtag rows / FTS                             | After search/`timeline.tag` p95 evidence (Doc B PR6)   |
| D1-4 | Timeline preload: `Promise.all` vs single `runD1Batch` | Defer until metrics show a success criterion           |
| D1-5 | Hot-key Durable Object for write serialization         | Only with evidence beyond D1 primary                   |

## Done recently (do not re-open)

- Admin custom emojis: `/api/v1/admin/custom_emojis` CRUD (bucket `emoji/` + `custom_emojis`), merged with `CUSTOM_EMOJIS`
- Tag actions: follow/unfollow, tag documents with 7-day history, featured tags (10 cap) + suggestions
- Conversation mutes: `status_mutes` by thread root, `muted` flag, timeline/notification suppression
- Custom emojis (`CUSTOM_EMOJIS`) and announcements (`ANNOUNCEMENTS`) replace the last placeholder routes
- Remote search: cached remote actors + `resolve=true` WebFinger/actor resolution
- Pinned statuses: pin/unpin, five-pin limit, `?pinned=true` account statuses
- Status edit: PUT/PATCH `/statuses/:id`, `/history`, `/source`, `status_edits` snapshots, `edited_at`, Update activity
- Instance rules served from `INSTANCE_RULES` (v1 rules endpoint + v2 instance)
- Suggestions (v1/v2) and trends/links derived from local accounts and public notes
- Notifications: clear, dismiss, unread_count (marker-aware, honoring blocks/mutes)
- Path-safe remote account ids: `r_` + base64url actor URI; accounts/:id and follow request targets decode it
- Blocks + mutes: endpoints, relationship flags, home/list/direct timeline suppression, notification gating; `d1PrepareTyped` expands repeated `$N`
- Follow requests: list/authorize/reject for local + remote pending, Accept/Reject delivery, `remote_follows.follow_activity_id`
- json_each membership; TypedSQL fixed SQL; wrangler migrations SoT ADRs
- `runTypedBatch`; ExpandFollowers remote-only + chunked targets
- Create saga mentions-before-notify; `enqueueLocalActivity` Result
- Expired-poll bulk `mastodonStatuses`
- Analytics indexes: `outbox.expand`, `outbox.enqueue`, `search`, `timeline.tag`
